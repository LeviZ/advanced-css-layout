#ADVANCED CSS LAYOUT

1- Implemented **Responsive Grid System** and **Flexbox** was used for modules.

**Flexbox Notes:** Flexbox was added only to the `.modal_album` module. In order to exhibit this, we reversed the order of the items inside select containers. As for IE, even if flexbox does not work, page will display original order of items.



2- **SMACCS** principles used. main.css was divided into three css files:

- base.css
- layout.css
- modules.css

#####   *There are media queries that are included as a part of the Responsive Grid System. We chose not to  create a separate "state.css" file to include these media queries.*
